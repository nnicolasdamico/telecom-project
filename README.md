Using a variety of data analysis techniques to explore and understand the dataset and its relationship with the target variable 'Churn'.  
Some of the key findings include:
- The average tenure of customers is 32 months.
- Less than 25% of customers have a tenure exceeding 55 months.
- On average, monthly charges associated with customers are $64, and total charges amount to $2283.
- The average tenure of customers who churned is 17 months, with average monthly charges of $74 and average total charges below those of customers who did not churn.
- 73.4% of customers have not churned (26.6% have churned).
- 55% of customers have a Month-to-Month contract.
- 20.9% of customers have a one-year contract.
- 24.1% of customers have a two-year contract.
- Customers tend to stay beyond the 60-month mark, while most churns occur within the first 5 months.
- Most churns happen in the early months, typically with lower charges. As the months progress, those with higher charges tend to churn, but the number of churns 
  after 60 months is very low.


  Theese findings provide valuable insights into customer behavior and can inform strategies to reduce churn and optimize revenue generation. Further analysis and modeling may be conducted to develop actionable recommendations based on these observations.
